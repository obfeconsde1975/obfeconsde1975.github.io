The traditions of Jainism say that he was a king and renounced the kingdom in favor of his son, Bharata, and became an ascetic.</p></li><li><p>The name <i>Bharatavarsha</i> is after Bharata, the son of Rishabhanath as per the Puranic traditions.</p></li><li><p>Parsvanath was the twenty-third Tirthankara, he renounced the world at the age of thirty and attained the enlightenment (perfect knowledge) after nearly three months of intense meditation and spent the remaining life as a religious teacher. He had lived 250 years before Mahavira.</p></li></ul><h2>Mahavira</h2><ul><li><p>Vardhamana Mahavira was the twenty-fourth and the last Tirthankara of Jainism.</p></li><li><p>Mahavira was born about 540 B.C. in the village <i>Kunda-grama</i> near Vaisali. He was the only son of Siddhartha and Trisala. Siddhartha was the head of famous <i>kshatriya Jnatrika</i> clan and Trisala was the sister of Chetaka, an eminent Lichchhavi noble of Vaisali. Chetaka's daughter was married to the king of Magadha, Bimbisara.</p></li><li><p>Mahavira was married to Yasoda and lived a life of a householder. After the death of his parents, Mahavira left his home at the age of thirty, and became an ascetic.</p></li><li><p>Mahavira had practiced most rigorous asceticism for the next twelve years and attained <i>kaivalya</i> at the age of 42 years.</p></li><li><p>As per the Jainism, <i>Kaivalya</i> is the supreme knowledge and final liberation from the bonds of pleasure and pain.</p></li><li><p><a href='/process-lasso-pro-serial-key.html'>Process</a> lasso pro serial key. After attaining <i>Kaivalya</i>, Mahavira came to be known as Mahavira and Jina or the conqueror and spent his remaining life in preaching. His followers came to be known as <i>Jainas</i>. Initially, they were designated as <i>Nirgranthas</i>, which means free from fetters.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>In 468 B.C., Mahavira passed away at Pawapuri at the age of 72 years. He spent 30 years of his life in preaching his teachings.</p></li><li><p>Four <b>doctrines</b> of Parsvanath are −</p><ul><li><p>Non-injury to living beings,</p></li><li><p>Speaking the truth,</p></li><li><p>Non-possession of property, and</p></li><li><p>Not stealing.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Vardhaman Mahavira accepted four doctrines of Parsvanath and added Celibacy as a fifth one to them.</p></li><li><p>Celibacy is the complete renunciation and free from any possessions. Mahavira asked his followers to discard even their clothes.</p></li></ul><h2>Jain’s Mythology</h2><ul><li><p>The universe is eternal.</p></li><li><p>The world is not created, maintained, or destroyed by a God, but it functions through a universal or eternal law.</p></li><li><p>Jains did not deny the existence of God, but they simply ignored.</p></li><li><p>The existence of the universe is divided into cycles of progress (<i>Utsarpini</i>) and declines (<i>Avasarpim</i>). It functions through the interaction of living souls (<i>Jiva</i>) and everything in the universe has a soul.</p></li><li><p>The souls are found not only in the living beings like animals and plants, but also in stones, rocks, water, etc.</p></li><li><p>The purification of the soul is the purpose of living.</p></li><li><p>Only the pure soul after being released from the body resides in heaven.</p></li><li><p>The soul, which has finally set itself free, rises at once to the top of the universe, above the highest heaven where it remains in an inactive omniscient bliss through eternity. It is known as <i><b>‘Nirvana’</b></i> in the Jainism.</p></li><li><p>According to Jainism, salvation is possible only by −</p><ul><li><p>Deserting all belongings,</p></li><li><p>A long course of fasting,</p></li><li><p>Self-mortification,</p></li><li><p>Study, and</p></li><li><p>Meditation.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Jainism, therefore, says that the monastic life is essential for salvation.</p></li><li><p>According to the Jaina tradition, the king Chandragupta Maurya has supported Jainism. He had accepted Jaina religion and abdicated the throne and died as a Jaina Bhikshu in the southern part of India.</p></li><li><p>Two hundred years after the death of Mahavira (during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya), a terrible famine broke out in Magadha. Bhadrabahu was the chief of the Jaina community at that time.</p></li><li><p>Bhadrabahu went to Karnataka with his followers and Sthulabhadra remained in Magadha as the in-charge of Jainism.</p></li><li><p>Bhadrabahu convoked a council at Patliputra, in which the Jaina canon was arranged.</p></li><li><p>Later in the 5<sup>th</sup> century A.D., the Jaina canon was further rearranged when the Jainas returned from south India. From where Jainism divided into two sects.</p></li><li><p>Those who returned from southern India held that complete nudity is an essential part of the teachings of Mahavira while the monks in Magadha began to put on white clothes.</p></li><li><p>Those who put on white robes known as <i><b>‘Svetambaras’</b></i> and those who were stark naked were called as <i><b>‘Digambaras</b>.’</i></p></li></ul><h2><span>Buddhism and Jainism</span></h2><p><span><em><u>Causes for the Growth of Buddhism and Jainism</u></em></span></p><ul><li>The Vedic rituals were expensive and the sacrifices</li><li>prescribed were very complicated and had lost Their meaning.</li><li>The caste system had become rigid.</li><li>Supremacy of the Brahmins created unrest.</li><li>All the religious texts were in Sanskrit, which was Not understandable to the masses.</li></ul><h4><strong><em><u><span>Buddhism</span></u></em></strong></h4><p><span><strong><em><u>Buddha’s Life</u></em></strong></span></p><ul><li>Gautama, the Buddha also known as Siddhartha, Sakyamuni and Tathagata.</li><li>Born in 563 BC (widely accepted), at Lumbini, near Kapilvastu, capital of the Sakya republic.</li><li>Left home at the age of 29 and attained Nirvana at the age of 35 at Bodh Gaya.</li><li>Attained Nirvana or Enlightenment at 35 at Uruvela, Gaya in Magadha (Bihar) under the Pipaltree</li><li>Delivered his first sermon at Sarnath.</li><li>He attained Mahaparinirvana at Kusinara in 483 BC.</li><li>His first sermonis called ‘Dharmachakrapravartan’ or ‘Turning of the Wheel of Law’.</li><li>Attained Mahaparinirvana at Kushinagar (identical with village Kasia in Deoria district of U.P.) in 483 B.C. at the age of 80 in the Malla republic.</li></ul><p><span><strong><em><u>Buddhist Councils</u></em></strong></span></p><p><strong><em><u>First council</u></em></strong>:-</p><ul><li>Year – 483 B.C</li><li>Place-Rajgrihi</li><li>Presided-Mahakshayap</li><li>Patron-Ajatshatru</li><li>Results-teaching of Buddha dived into two parts – vinay pattika &amp; sutta patika</li></ul><p><strong><em><u>Second council:-</u></em></strong></p><ul><li>Year –322 B.C</li><li>Place-Vaishali</li><li>Presided-Sabakami</li><li>Patron-Kalashok</li><li>Results-follower dived into two parts Sthavirmadins and Mahasanghikas.</li></ul><p><strong><em><u>Third council</u></em></strong>:-</p><ul><li>Year – 250 B.C</li><li>Place-Patliputra</li><li>Presided-Mogliputta Tissa</li><li>Patron-Asoka</li><li>Results-Third pattika Abhidhama patika compiled.</li></ul><p><strong><em><u>Fourth council</u></em></strong>:-</p><ul><li>Year –72 A.D</li><li>Place-Kundalvan (Kashmir)</li><li>Presided-Vasumitra</li><li>Patron-Kanishka</li><li>Results-Buddhist divided into two parts Mahayan &amp;Hinyan .</li></ul><p><strong><em><u><span>Buddhist Philosophy</span></u></em></strong></p><ul><li>Idealism: Two source of valid knowledge:</li></ul><p>(a) Perception and (b) Inference.</p><ul><li><strong><em><u>Doctrine of dependent origination (Pratisamutpada</u></em></strong>): Central theory of Buddhist Philosophy.
