Fast downloads of the latest free software! IMovie for iOS and iMovie for macOS are designed to work together. You can start cutting a project on your iPhone, then use AirDrop or iCloud Drive to wirelessly transfer it to your iPad. You can also send a project from your iPhone or iPad to your Mac for finishing.</p><p>iMovie is the video editing software for the average Joe. Well, any average Joe that uses an Apple device. This is the go-to program for those who want to start editing their own videos. Like all Apple products, it is simple and functions easily across connected Apple libraries and devices. Once your Apple devices are synced, iMovie can serve as a home movie portal. It conveniently stores and organizes all imported photo and video files. Even better, it takes advantage of iCloud and iMovie Theater program to give you a platform to debut videos, movies and trailers in 4K resolution in any Apple device and HDTV.</p><h3>Personalize your videos</h3><blockquote>iMovie’s feature improves your video’s appearance and audio.</blockquote><p>Ever taken a video on the fly? It's unpredictable. Once videos and photos have been imported, you can trim clips, add close-ups, enhance audio, and even remove sound, and comes handy when you want to make changes, but don't know where to begin. Preview with Trailers: you can make any video look like a blockbuster when you use iMovie’s Hollywood-inspired movie trailers. Each template has its own original score, graphics, and animated transitions. The transitions are predetermined visual breaks created by the photos and videos you import. To add a more personal touch, you can add their own movie title, end credits, and even a customized studio logo.</p><p>Create Movies: iMovie is one of the easiest video editing tools to use, letting editors click and drag imported clips into the timeline, as well as automatically lock on adjacent videos. An important tool is the Precision Editor. It controls when a video fades in or out by showing an exact timestamp before and after the transition. Another important feature is Clip Connection, which holds all media together when you move a clip.</p><p>In addition to trimming, you can even crop and rotate videos. Yup. That's right. Both photos and videos. The difference between the two media sources is the Ken Burns pan-and-zoom effect that photos automatically get. The effect is more engaging than ever before. </p><p>Then there's the Autocorrect button—the cherry on top. Like a magic wand, it enhances the lighting and color on all kinds of videos. It’s a huge help in videos shot on the spot where little thought was given to lighting and color. Other common video enhancing tools are color matching for a seamless filter on every frame, white balance from a specific area in each frame, and the dropper tool to enhance colors and skin tones.</p><h3>Edit anywhere, anytime</h3><img src='https://discussions.apple.com/content/attachment/982981040' alt='Mac' title='Mac'><p>Apple sets iMovie apart from other entry-level video editors by making it compatible with Apple desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablet devices. Of course, the iPhone and iPad versions do not have all the features of the desktop version. Yet, it is incredibly useful for anyone who has an idea for a video and wants to conceptualize it. To put it simply, it is a lifesaver for creative ideas, especially in the eyes of professional video editors. Simply select the video or videos you want to edit on the Photos app. Click Edit and the iMovie app will automatically launch your already-imported videos. Once you have started creating your movie on the app, it will be uploaded on iCloud and you will be able to work across various Apple devices.</p><p>Another perk of having the app version in your iPhone or iPad is that you can create productions like daily video diaries and vlogs in a snap. When you’re finished, you can send the final product thru iMessage, Facebook, email, and other social media platforms. </p><h3>Full support</h3><p>Apple Inc. offers a well-organized and detailed customer support website. You can find a solution for every Apple product. In Apple’s customer support website, you will find user guides, tutorials, and support communities. You can also schedule a phone, live chat, email and have one-to-one support if you need a more detailed guide. It is important to know that Apple does not have an email address published online, so all inquiries should be made on Apple’s official customer support website or their hotlines.</p><h3>Where can you run this program? </h3><p>Because iMovie exclusively runs on Apple devices, Windows users will have to run on over to the Apple store if they want to get their hands on the video editing software app. Not only is it free for all new macOS and iOS devices, it's pre-installed! This latter feature exceeds expectations and offers a bit more value. Users who are looking to take the plunge can feel free to try out Apple devices on display or ask for assistance.</p><p>Current Apple users are in luck. iMovie for macOS requires only 2GB of RAM and an OS X Mavericks to edit videos. Editors who want to make the most of the program are recommended to have a 2011 iMac or Macbook Pro with at least 4GB of RAM. These devices can export videos with 4K resolution. The latest version of iMovie, version 10.1.11 requires OS X 10.11.2 or later.</p><h3>Is there a better alternative? </h3><p>In general, other entry-level video editing tools don’t hold up to iMovie’s sleek and intuitive interface and its vast array of features. Wondershare Filmora, however, is a strong competitor. The video editing software is an established name amongst Apple and Windows users. Both its free and paid versions offer standard trimming, transitions, overlays, and effects. You can even put together one hundred layers of media—a feature that iMovie lacks.</p><h3>Our take</h3><p>iMovie is the user-friendly video editing application that turns your footage into stunning productions.The final output is not as sleek and professional as that of Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere or other professional editing tools, but that's all right. This software app is for dabblers, tinkerers and enthusiasts wanting to get those creative juices flowing without feeling overwhelmed.</p><p>We working hard to make Euro Truck Simulator 2 Activation Key Generator for Android and iOS systems.
